    	<h2>Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio Early Access</h2>
    	
        <p>We wish to give customers and users early access to Developer Studio so we can make the next version of Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio an even better environment for 
        developing on the JBoss Enterprise Platform.</p>
 We do our best to do this with our developers and internal QA, but we would also like to have real developers and real users 
 try out early builds to make sure we don't just cover the issues we find but also what upcoming users of devstudio might bump into.</p>

<h2>Program Structure And Terms</h2>

<p>The Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio Early Access program ran as a unmanaged program in which a small number of existing customers may choose to participate. 
The program started in <b>June 2011</b> and has now completed.  Although these Early Access releases are not officially supported by Red Hat 
Global Support team, the Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio product team will directly assist with participant questions. At the conclusion of the program, we 
expect customers to use the <a href="http://www.redhat.com/products/jbossenterprisemiddleware/developer-studio/">GA binaries</a> in their ongoing development process. After the <a href="http://www.redhat.com/products/jbossenterprisemiddleware/developer-studio/">GA release</a>, any kind of support for Early Access releases 
will cease to exist. <a href="readme.html">Click here for more information.</a>
